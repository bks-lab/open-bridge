# Bridge Audit — Check Implementation

Per-check algorithms (overview table + arguments live in SKILL.md). Severity:
`P0` broken state · `P1` visible drift · `P2` cleanup · `P3` cosmetic.
Scan tracked files only (`git ls-files`); findings are advisory unless `--fix` rules at the end apply.

---

## Check 1 — License consistency

**Sources to read:**
- `README.md`: shields.io License badge (regex `License%3A-([A-Za-z0-9.+-]+)`) + footer line near end (`Apache 2.0 — see LICENSE`, `MIT — see LICENSE`)
- `LICENSE`: first 3 lines (Apache header / MIT header)
- `CLAUDE.md`: any "License: " claim
- `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md` (if available): any `MIT`/`Apache`/`license` mention

**Algorithm:**
1. Extract license-name from each source
2. Group by source. Disagreement → P0 finding.
3. Fix proposal: pick the source-of-truth (memory / CLAUDE.md if present and recent), align the others.

**Edge cases:**
- LICENSE missing → P0 finding (not a drift, but bad).
- README has no badge but has footer → use footer alone.

---

## Check 2 — Skill-tree truth

**Sources:**
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` — directory listing + `name:` frontmatter, `scope:` frontmatter
- `README.md` — directory tree block (`├── skills/` … `└──` lines) + any skill table in body
- `AGENTS.md` — skill table

**Algorithm:**
1. Build truth set: `actual = set(directory listing of skills/)`
2. Build claim sets: `readme_claimed`, `agents_claimed`
3. Findings:
   - **Dead refs:** in claim, not in actual → P1 ("README mentions `<name>/` — does not exist")
   - **Missing:** in actual, not in any claim (with scope `core` only — org/user can be omitted) → P2
   - **Frontmatter mismatch:** SKILL.md `name:` != directory name → P1

---

## Check 3 — Standing-order count

**Sources:**
- `protocols/standing-orders/*.md` (excluding `_template.md`, `README.md`)
- All Markdown files: any line matching `\b(\d+)\s+(?:standing[- ]orders?)\b`

**Algorithm:**
1. `actual = count(protocols/standing-orders/*.md non-template, non-README)`
2. For each match in step 2, compare. Disagreement → P1.
3. Fix proposal: prefer "Standing orders" without a number — drift-resistant.

---

## Check 4 — Renamed-everywhere

**Sources:**
- `data/renames.yaml` — list of `{ old, new, exceptions: [paths] }`
- `git ls-files` content

**Algorithm:**
1. For each rename: `git grep -n -F "$old" -- $(git ls-files) | grep -v '^binary'`
2. Skip hits in files listed in `exceptions:` for that rename
3. Skip hits inside YAML frontmatter `aliases:` arrays (those are intentional)
4. Each remaining hit → P1 finding with line + suggested replacement

**Why exceptions matter:** intentional old-name mentions (e.g. backwards-compat
alias triggers in a SKILL.md) would otherwise stay flagged forever.

---

## Check 5 — Cross-reference validity

**Sources:**
- All `*.md` files
- All `*.yaml` files with `path:` / `config:` fields

**Algorithm:**
1. Extract patterns:
   - Markdown link: `\[[^\]]+\]\(([^)]+)\)` (skip http/https/mailto)
   - Code-fenced path-like: `` `([a-z][a-z0-9_./-]+\.(md|yaml|yml|py|sh|json))` ``
   - YAML `path:` / `config:` values
2. Resolve relative to file's directory
3. Stat the result. Missing → P2 finding.

**Edge cases:**
- Anchor links (`#section`) — skip the anchor portion, check the file
- Glob patterns (`workflow/projects/<slug>.yaml`) — skip if contains `<` or `*`
- External URLs — skip

---

## Check 6 — Scope coverage (frontmatter + schema-backed instances)

**Sources — two groups, different severity:**

*Group A — markdown frontmatter:*
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter — scope under `metadata:` (`metadata.scope`,
  optional, defaults to `core`). It nests there because skill-creator's
  validator forbids non-standard top-level keys.
- `.claude/agents/*.md` frontmatter (top-level `scope:`, optional, defaults to `core`)
- `rules/*.md` frontmatter — scope **REQUIRED**, hard-gated by
  `scripts/validate-bridge.py --surface rules` in pre-commit + CI. Rules are
  **tiered by FOLDER** (`rules/*.md` = core · `rules/org/**` = org ·
  `rules/user/**` = user); the folder is the promote tier, so the frontmatter
  `scope:` MUST match the folder. **Flag a mismatch** → **P1** (mis-routed —
  a wrong top-level core would leak an org rule to the OSS upstream). Also
  flag a skill whose `metadata.scope` is missing/invalid (already hard-gated
  by `scripts/validate-skill-scope.py` in pre-commit + CI).

*Group B — cluster-wrapper YAML instances (scope is a REQUIRED schema field):*
- `identity/{mandants,accounts,personas}/*.yaml` ·
  `workflow/{contexts,projects}/*.yaml` · `infra/{remotes,channels}/*.yaml`
- Skip `_`-prefixed files (`_schema.yaml`, `_template.yaml`) and `*.template`.
- `infra/remotes` + `infra/channels` are single-tier local — always
  `user`/`private` — but the scope field is still schema-required as a
  promote tripwire. `infra/backups/` has no `_schema.yaml` yet; when one
  is authored, add it here.

**Algorithm:**
1. For each Group-A file: check if `scope:` is present in frontmatter
   (for `skills/*/SKILL.md` look under `metadata.scope`; for `.claude/agents/*.md`
   look top-level).
   - Missing on `skills/` / `.claude/agents/` → **P2** ("scope: core implied, but explicit is better")
   - Missing on `rules/*.md` → **P1** (leak risk — already hard-failed by `validate-bridge.py`)
2. For each Group-B instance: check if top-level `scope:` is present.
   - Missing → **P1** ("scope is a required schema field — `check-jsonschema`
     fails AND `/promote` cannot route it; this is the mandant mis-routing
     class"). Fix: add `scope:` with the correct tier.
3. For ALL files: if `scope:` is something other than the generic tiers
   `core | org | user | private` (plus any org-aliases configured in
   `bridge-config.yaml` `promote.scopes.org_aliases`, i.e. the org's short
   tag) → **P1** ("unknown scope value").
4. Group-B sanity tier rules (advisory P2 — flag, don't hard-fail):
   - a mandant / account / persona / context / project tagged `core` or
     `org` is suspect (these carry PII / customer data) → flag for review.

**Why:** explicit `scope:` is what `/promote` and `/bridge-sync` route on —
a missing Group-B scope means the config silently fails to route. Confirm via
`check-jsonschema --schemafile <wrapper>/<type>/_schema.yaml <wrapper>/<type>/*.yaml`.

**Do NOT conflate** with `protocols/standing-orders/*.md`, whose `scope:`
field means standing-order applicability (`always | per-repo |
per-context`), not scope routing — those are out of scope for Check 6.

---

## Check 7 — Routing-SoT conflicts

**Sources:**
- All `*.md` files: tables with header containing "Source of Truth" or "SoT" or "Resolved by"
- `rules/operations.md`, `docs/extension-model.md`, `docs/structure.md` (high-yield files)

**Algorithm:**
1. Parse each routing-table row: `(domain, sot_path, resolver_skill)`
2. Group by `(domain, sot_path)` across files
3. If the same `(domain, sot_path)` appears with different `resolver_skill` or different routing rule → P2 finding
4. If the same `domain` has different `sot_path` claimants → P1 finding

---

## Check 8 — Typo lint

**Sources:**
- `data/typo-patterns.yaml` — list of `{ pattern, suggestion }`
- All tracked `*.md` and `*.yaml` files

**Algorithm:**
1. For each pattern: `git grep -n -E "$pattern"`
2. Each hit → P3 finding with suggestion

The pattern list ships in `data/typo-patterns.yaml` — read it there, don't
duplicate it here.

---

## Check 9 — Cross-repo skill-tree sync coverage

Only runs with `--cross-repo`. Detects file-state drift between the
seed repo and each configured upstream that commit-based syncs miss:

- **Forward-drop:** a `scope: core` (or `scope: org`, for your org overlay)
  skill exists locally but is missing in the target's trunk
- **Reverse-leak:** a directory in the target's `skills/` is currently
  `scope: user`/`private` in the seed repo and shouldn't be there

**Sources:**
- Local: `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter (current scope — under `metadata.scope`)
- Target trunks: `git ls-tree -d <upstream>/<branch> skills/` (after `git fetch`)

**Algorithm:**
1. Build local truth: `{ skill: scope }` for every `skills/*/SKILL.md`
2. For each upstream `<repo>` with allowed-scopes `<allowed>`
   (open-bridge → `{core}`, your org overlay → `{core, org}`):
   - `expected = { s for s,scope in local if scope in allowed }`
   - `actual   = ls-tree of <upstream>/<branch>:skills/`
   - `forward_drops = expected - actual` → P1 finding per skill
   - `reverse_leaks = actual - expected` → P1 finding per skill
3. For each forward-drop, identify the originating commit and whether
   it was MIXED (the common forward-drop cause):
   - `git log --diff-filter=A -- skills/<name>/SKILL.md | tail -1`
   - If the commit also touched `scope: user` paths → annotate
     "MIXED commit; sync skipped — needs per-file cherry-pick"
4. For each reverse-leak, identify when it entered the target:
   - `(cd <target>; git log -- skills/<name>/SKILL.md | tail -1)`
   - Annotate "entered <date>; current source scope: user"

**Severity:** P1 by default. P0 if a forward-drop has been outstanding
for >2 sync windows (defined as 2× the gap between most recent
`bridge-sync-*` tags) — that signals the auto-fix isn't running.

**Fix proposal:**
- Forward-drop → "Run `/bridge-sync` (Step 0 will produce a side-PR)"
- Reverse-leak → "Run `/bridge-sync` (Step 0 will produce a cleanup PR)"
- The audit never auto-applies cross-repo fixes; that stays in
  `/bridge-sync` so PR review happens through one channel.

**Separation from `bridge-leak-check`:** that skill scans file *content*
(strings + classification); Check 9 checks directory-presence + scope-policy.
Run both for independent signals on the same drift.

---

## Check 10 — Agent-identity health

Validates the `identity/agent/` layer (SOUL.md + IDENTITY.md). Always
runs — no `--cross-repo` needed.

The repo ships only the templates (`identity/agent/_template.SOUL.md` +
`_template.IDENTITY.md`); the live `SOUL.md`/`IDENTITY.md` are USER
instances seeded at onboarding (see `identity/agent/README.md`). A fresh
clone has neither file — that is the shipped state, not drift.

**What it checks:**
1. Onboarding gate: if `bridge-config.yaml` is absent (fresh clone, not
   onboarded), **skip** the existence checks — missing instance files are
   expected, no finding.
2. If onboarded (`bridge-config.yaml` exists) and `identity/agent/SOUL.md`
   or `IDENTITY.md` is missing → **P2** advisory: seed them from
   `identity/agent/_template.SOUL.md` / `_template.IDENTITY.md`.
3. (When present) SOUL.md size ≤ 80 lines AND ≤ 4 KB. Over → **P2** (loaded every session; bloat degrades signal). Report actual `wc -l` + `wc -c`.
4. (When present) Both files carry valid frontmatter: `schema_version`, `type` (soul|identity), `scope` (core|user), `last_updated`. Missing/invalid → **P2**.
5. (When present) IDENTITY.md references the active theme's `assistant_name` rather than hardcoding a name that disagrees with it → **P3** advisory on conflict.

**Commands:**
```bash
test -f bridge-config.yaml || echo "fresh clone — skip existence checks"
wc -l identity/agent/SOUL.md          # expect ≤ 80
wc -c identity/agent/SOUL.md          # expect ≤ 4096
test -f identity/agent/IDENTITY.md && echo present || echo missing
```

**Fix mode:** none — advisory only. Voice/identity content is
human-owned and never auto-edited (consistent with the propose-don't-apply
rule in `rules/learning-autonomy.md`).

---

## Check 11 — Gate-shaped memory without a `rules/` home

When a memory file's body reads like a *rule* — an imperative the agent must
always/never follow, or a "when X → do Y" routing instruction — that behavior
is trapped where only this instance can see it. It should be **promoted** to
`rules/<tier>/`, with the memory kept as dated provenance. This is the audit
backstop for `rules/knowledge-growth.md` (where new knowledge belongs).

**Sources:**
- `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/*.md` (the active memory dir for this repo;
  resolve via the harness path, skip `MEMORY.md` itself — it is the index)
- `rules/*.md`, `rules/bks/**/*.md`, `rules/user/**/*.md` — the rule corpus

**Gate-language heuristic (a memory body is "gate-shaped" if):**
1. **Imperative + scope adverb** — a directive verb (the bridge "must / always
   / never" do X) near an always/never token: `always`, `never`, `immer`,
   `nie`, `niemals`, `IMMER`, `NIE`, `stets`, `grundsätzlich`. Caps-lock
   variants count double (users tend to write hard rules in caps).
2. **Routing "when X → do Y"** — a conditional trigger mapped to an action:
   `→`, `->`, "when … then", "bei … →", "falls …", "wenn … dann". This is the
   shape of a standing-order or a skill-routing rule.
3. Plain *observations* (a one-time fact, an API quirk, a snapshot of state,
   a decision-and-why) are NOT gate-shaped — they belong in memory. The
   distinction: a gate tells the agent **what to do every time**; an
   observation records **what is/was true once**.

**Algorithm:**
1. For each memory file (excluding `MEMORY.md`): score the body against the
   gate-language heuristic. Need at least one strong signal (cap-lock
   always/never, or an explicit `→`/"when X do Y" mapping) — a lone lowercase
   "always" in prose is not enough (avoid false positives on observations).
2. If gate-shaped: search the rule corpus for a corresponding rule. Match on
   topic, not exact string — grep the memory's `name:`-slug keywords and the
   distinctive nouns (skill names, paths, vocabulary triggers) against
   `rules/**/*.md`. A rule "covers" the memory if a `rules/` file encodes the
   same imperative or routing.
3. No covering rule found → **P2** finding. The memory is a behavioral rule
   with no enforceable home.
4. Tier hint for the fix: the memory's subject decides the destination —
   generic agent behavior → `rules/<tier>/` core (English); BKS/customer
   routing → `rules/bks/`; personal/freelance → `rules/user/`. Match the
   folder-tier convention in `rules/knowledge-growth.md` § Rules are tiered
   by folder.

**Finding shape:** `P2 — memory/<file> — body is a hard gate but no rules/
file encodes it → Promote to rules/<tier>/<slug>.md (memory kept as provenance).`

**Why a P2 (not higher):** the memory still works in this instance — but the
rule never promotes and never gets enforced by a hook/CI. Drift, not breakage.

**Edge cases / what NOT to flag:**
- Memories already cross-referenced from a `rules/` file (the rule cites the
  memory as provenance) → covered, skip. This is the *intended* end-state.
- The consolidated SOUL.md/IDENTITY.md voice rules under the `MEMORY.md`
  "Consolidated into identity/agent/" banner — those have a home in
  `identity/agent/`, not `rules/`, and the banner says so. Treat
  `identity/agent/SOUL.md` + `IDENTITY.md` as valid rule-homes too.
- A memory that is genuinely an observation with an incidental "never" in
  prose (e.g. "this API never returns null on success") → not gate-shaped.

**Fix mode:** none — advisory only. Promoting a memory to a rule is a
human-authored content move (translation, tier choice, framing); the audit
only surfaces the candidate.

## Check 12 — Config-driven CORE skills

A `scope: core` skill ships and merges to the OSS upstream, so it must stay
generic *inside*: it reads instance specifics from config, it does not embed
them. This check flags the inverse — a CORE skill that hardcodes what should
live in `bridge-config.yaml` / `workflow/` / `infra/` / `identity/`. It is the
audit backstop for `CLAUDE.md` § Generic CORE Skills (and `docs/extension-model.md`
§ Generic CORE Skills). Distinct from `bridge-leak-check`: leak-check is
content-safety (PII / customer names → leak); Check 12 is genericity drift —
even a *non-PII* hardcode (your own org's project number baked into a core
skill) breaks upstream-mergeability and is in scope here.

**Sources:**
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` and `skills/*/references/**/*.md` where `metadata.scope`
  is `core` or absent (absent defaults to core).
- Skip non-core skills (`metadata.scope: org | user | private`) — they are
  allowed to be instance-specific.

**Hardcode heuristic — a line is a hit when it presents a CONCRETE operative
value that should be config:**
1. **Org/project/pipeline IDs** — a numeric tracker ID tied to project /
   pipeline / board / org context in operative prose (e.g. `project 18`,
   `pipeline 1234`, an ADO query GUID), as the value to use — not as an example.
2. **Embedded tracker queries** — a literal KQL / WIQL / JQL / SQL string with
   concrete index/table/project names baked in, instead of "read the query from
   `integrations.{name}.*` / `workflow/projects/<slug>.yaml`".
3. **Absolute instance paths / concrete hosts** — `/Users/<realname>/…`, a
   specific machine name, a tenant ID, as the operative path rather than a
   `${variable}` or a config-resolved path.
4. **Persona / customer / stakeholder proper names** as routing values (defer
   the PII angle to `bridge-leak-check`; flag here as a genericity hit too).

**NOT a hit (avoid false positives):**
- Placeholder tokens: `<slug>`, `<id>`, `{name}`, `<your-org>`, `acme`,
  `example.com`, and similar generic stand-ins — that *is* the generic form.
- `docs/examples/**` and any fenced block explicitly labelled as an example.
- A skill *naming the config key it reads* (e.g. "read `integrations.ado.queries`
  from `bridge-config.yaml`") — that is the correct, config-driven pattern.
- The `${variable}` interpolation forms (CLAUDE.md § Variable Interpolation).

**Algorithm:**
1. Enumerate core skills (resolve `metadata.scope`; absent → core).
2. For each `SKILL.md` + `references/**` file, scan for the four hardcode
   patterns above, excluding the NOT-a-hit set.
3. Each concrete hit → **P2** finding. Fix: move the value to
   `bridge-config.yaml` (or the matching `workflow/` / `infra/` / `identity/`
   file, plus a template/example default) and have the skill read it.

**Finding shape:** `P2 — skills/<name>/<file>:<line> — hardcoded <id|query|path|
name> in a scope:core skill → move to bridge-config.yaml (skill reads it). See
CLAUDE.md § Generic CORE Skills.`

**Why a P2 (not higher):** the skill still runs in this instance — but it has
stopped being generic, so it no longer merges cleanly upstream. Drift, not
breakage. (A genuine PII / customer hardcode is escalated separately by
`bridge-leak-check`.)

**The test:** *would this line be wrong in someone else's Bridge?* If yes, it
is instance config, not skill content.

**Fix mode:** none — advisory only. Moving a value into config is a
human-authored content move (choosing the key, adding a template default,
rewiring the read).

---

## --cross-repo mode

**Prerequisites:** `bridge-config.yaml.upstreams[]` defines targets and `gh` is authenticated.

**Algorithm:**
1. For each upstream: `git clone --depth=1 --branch=$branch` into `/tmp/bridge-audit-<repo>/` (or `git fetch <upstream> <branch>` if already added as a remote)
2. Diff `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `LICENSE` between local and each upstream
3. Findings:
   - File present in seed repo but not upstream → P2 (missing on that destination)
   - Different License/badge/footer between repos → P0 (cross-repo license drift)
   - Significant content divergence (>30 lines diff in README/AGENTS) → P2 (worth a sync)
4. Run **Check 9** (skill-tree sync coverage) against the same fetched trunks

---

## --fix mode

`--fix` only applies when the fix is **completely unambiguous** and
**single-line**; multi-line replacements always stay advisory. For everything
not marked fixable below: print the suggested fix, leave application to the user.

| Check | Fixable? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 License | Footer line only (`Apache 2.0 — see LICENSE` → `MIT — see LICENSE`) | Single-line, deterministic |
| 2 Skill-tree | No | Multi-line, requires curation |
| 3 Standing-order count | Replace number with word ("8 standing orders" → "Standing orders") | Deterministic |
| 4 Renames | Yes, when not in exceptions | Whole-word grep+replace |
| 5 Xrefs | No | Could rename or remove — needs judgment |
| 6 Scope | Insert `scope: core` after `name:` line | Deterministic IF user opted in |
| 7 Routing-SoT | No | Architectural decision needed |
| 8 Typos | Single-token patterns only (e.g. `gepushtdurch` → `gepusht durch`) | Whitelist |
| 9 Skill-tree sync | No | Cross-repo mutation — defer to `/bridge-sync` Step 0 |
| 11 Memory-gate | No | Promotion needs translation + tier choice — human-authored move |
| 12 Config-driven | No | Move-to-config is a content move — advisory only |
